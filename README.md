## About The Project

This tool allows users to:

- ðŸ’¬ **Chat with the TextMiner** to semantically search student bios using NLP.
- ðŸ“Š **Chat with the GraphMiner** to generate interactive graphs of relationships based on either student names or certifications.

It's designed for educators, administrators, and data explorers who want to interactively analyze educational data.

## Built With

This tech stack powers the dynamic chat interface and graph-based exploration in the project. Streamlit and st-chat provide an intuitive chat UI, while Pandas and NetworkX handle the data and visualization logic.
